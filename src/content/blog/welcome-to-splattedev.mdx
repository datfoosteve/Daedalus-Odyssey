Hey there! Welcome to my new website. If you don't know who I am already, my name is [Daedalus]

### The Stack

The technologies I used to build have been such a pleasure to use. The developer experience using Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind is unmatched. It's only been a month since I really started to learn Next.js in particular and I am already in love with it. Big shoutout to Vercel, those guys rock.
